# CPSC-483-Final-Project

This GitHub repository contains code for my CPSC 483 Project, examining disease-gene link prediction through the usage of Graph Convolutional Networks (GCN) and several tweaks to improve accuracy. Code is self-contained in the gae_testing jupyter notebook and is intended to be run on Google Colaboratory. Data file and package downloads are specified in the jupyter notebook.
